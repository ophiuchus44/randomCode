The story begins with the trial of a young banker, Andy Dufrense,
victimized by circumstantial evidence, resulting in a conviction for
the murder of his wife and her lover. After a quick conviction, Andy
finds himself serving a life sentence at Shawshank prison, with no hope
of parole. He exists in this prison only in appearance, keeping his
mind free from the drab walls around him. His ability to do this
results in the gaining of respect from his fellow inmates, but most of
all from Ellis Redding. Ellis, commonly referred to as Red, finds
gainful use of his entrepreneurial spirit within the drab walls of
Shawshank by dealing in contraband and commodities rare to the confines
of prison. Andy's demeanor and undeniable sense of hope causes Red to
take a deeper look at himself, and the world around him. Andy proves to
Red and the other inmates that in the conventional walls of Shawshank
prison convention will find no home in his lifestyle.<br/><br/>By creating the film's firm foundation, the meticulously chiseled
screenplay paved the way for this film's success. Frank Darabont
outdoes himself with the phenomenal adaptation of Stephen King's
equally noteworthy novella, Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption. In
this novella, King demonstrates that he can break free from the genre
he dominates and still create a marvelous piece of modern literature.
Though the film mirrors the novella in many ways, Darabont illustrates
a focused objective of improving upon the areas where the novella came
up short, resulting in one of the best book to film transitions ever.<br/><br/>While maintaining some of the poetic and moving dialogue of the
novella, Darabont also proves that a film's score can generate a great
deal of emotional response from its audience, as dialogue does. He
employs the cunning Thomas Newman, son of the legendary Hollywood
composer, Alfred Newman. Darabont shows recognition for the film's
needs by employing Newman, who makes the gentle piano chords whisper
softly to the viewer, as if a part of the scripted dialogue. Newman
lends himself to individualism and tends to drive more towards the
unique in the realm of score composition. His effort in Shawshank did
not go unnoticed, as his score received an Oscar nomination in 1995.
While unique and independent, Newman's score never once intrudes on
your concentration or distracts from the film.<br/><br/>With work from vast array of talented scene designers, costume
designers, composers, cinematographers, and various other Hollywood
artists, the cast of The Shawshank Redemption had a strong foundation
to work with. The marvelous cast of this film will dazzle you with some
of the most convincing performances you will witness in a film. While
both Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman shine as Andy and Red,
respectively, the true spectacle of acting lies within the plethora of
amazing supporting actors who easily disappear into their roles. Most
noticeable of these, the veteran film star James Whitmore, who portrays
the elderly Brooks Hatlen. Brooks, a man incarcerated for an
unmentioned crime for so long that he finds himself attached to the
Shawshank and the daily life he has lead. Each of these actors show a
true dedication to their art, and a focused purpose in their
motivations, creating a convincing setting that never once caters to
anything unbelievable. http://howtogetridofacnequick.org

If there was such a thing as a perfect movie, this is it. Of course,
for practical reasons, one cannot award a film ten stars out of ten,
because of the endless stream of new work demanding scrutiny. I'd like
also to start by quoting another well known film, which sums up my
opinion nicely. 'In many ways, the work of a critic is easy- we risk
very little, and thrive on negative criticism, which is amusing to
write and to read. But the harsh truth of the matter is that the
average piece of junk is probably more valuable than our criticism
designating it so'. This could not be closer to the truth. When it
comes down to the wire, critics risk everything in dishing out praise,
for fear of being ridiculed themselves.<br/><br/>There can be no such danger with The Shawshank Redemption. It is an
eternal masterpiece, timeless and inspiring. I avoid being clichéd,
when it is at all possible to do so, but The Shawshank Redemption is
beautiful, masterfully acted, with just that right amount of
tenderness. This is a tale of moral courage, and the everlasting fight
for justice. As with other films of the genre, one can tell what will
happen, of course, but when you watch this film, you will time and
again be genuinely surprised, and maybe even shed a tear for the
persistence and unquenchable thirst of the human spirit. One leaps for
joy after watching this incredible film, at the knowledge that evil, in
all senses of the word, can, and will never triumph.<br/><br/>Turning an eye to the technical side of things, just for a moment, I
can discern not one single badly executed shot. The Shawshank
Redemption is well written, and, as I have said before, brilliantly
acted. Characters that could be flat are all allowed to develop and
flourish, and the film is even better for it. The film grabs our
attention, right from the word go, with agitated shots of Andy looking
like he IS going to kill his wife. And the soundtrack. Well, there
isn't much to say; except that most of the music in this film is some
of the most beautiful I have ever heard.<br/><br/>This is a deeply satisfying, wonderful, brilliant, fantastic, soulful
cinematic work. Watch it, if you haven't seen it, and if you have, you
must agree that this excellent film will be an eternal classic. There
are, of course, films that people will prefer, I myself am strongly
attracted to Subway, a 1985 film by Luc Besson, but for pure facial and
objective value, cinema does not get much better than this.

From the summary above which you will have seen, i stated the film to
be a moving masterpiece. Right from the word go i was drawn into the
films twisting emotional plot. It caught my attention that Frank
Darabont has placed a small amount of aspects into the film that get
the audience emotionally involved in which we base ourselves into
simply putting our feet in one of the convicts shoes. Tt especially
caught my eyes with the montage of shots in which the character Brooks
(James Whitmore) takes his own life, the non-diagetic sound adding to
the other element of suspense of the scene and the devastation of the
tragic loss of the character in which we have been following through
the course of the film. The cinematography throughout the film was
basic and what i would term as standard, seen before basic film
camera-work. If this was better it would have highly improved the films
overall watch. throughout the course of the film we see Andy Dufresne
(Tim Robbins) supposedly framed for the murder of his wife and her
lover. We see how he progresses through the twenty years he spends at
Shawshank Prison. We see Robbins act brilliantly as the role of a
nimble, lost and lonely convict turn into a reliant of the Head Warden.
This all becomes of the fact that in Dufresne's previous life he was a
city banker, which is where he gets the nickname of 'wife murdering
banker' around the dim lit prison. Morgan Freeman also shows that he is
one of the worlds leading role- modelling actors as he pulls of another
supreme unique perform. The way he acts during the duration of the film
is entirely versatile proving the Freeman is an exceptional actor and
performs single handed an outstanding performance.<br/><br/>The plot consists of many twists and turns with both leading characters
getting into difficult situation and how they overcome them, or not.<br/><br/>The final half an hour of the film is soul touching and what i would
term as an emotional rollacoaster with a large twist at the end. As
suspense builds it creates a sensational climax tagging the film a must
watch!<br/><br/>I generally don't watch films more than once or twice but this is a
different story. It still amazes me to this day and still gets me
moving every time, it also influences me a lot.<br/><br/>If you haven't watched this i highly recommend you do so!<br/><br/>Joe Ferrari

Im not going to sit here and go into a deep explanation of what this
film is about, because that has been thoroughly explained in many of
the other reviews. What I will say is that The Shawshank Redemption is
without any doubt the most amazing film ever written. The acting is
tremendous, the story is original, and the movie itself has a deeper
meaning to it. This movie is not about the hardships of prison, it is
about the importance of friendship and the realization that hope is
your greatest aspect. This piece does not focus as much on Andy and his
great escape from Shawshank, but more on Red finding that there is
always meaning and a purpose for everything. The story really unfolds
when Brooks, an old timer that Andy and Red had been close friends
with, is put on parole and released from prison. After confronting the
outside world and knowing that he could not cope with it, Brooks finds
that he has no purpose outside of life in jail and hangs himself. Later
in the movie, after Andy makes his great escape from prison, Red is
finally released from Shawshank himself, and is put in the same
situation as Brooks. Only one reason marks the fact that Red himself
didn't commit suicide. That reason is Andy. Red figures out that he
does have a purpose outside of prison which is to see his best friend
again and to ""give him a handshake"". And as the movie comes to a
marvelous ending, that hope to see Andy becomes a reality.<br/><br/>Overall the best movie I have ever watched and I am glad to say that I
will continue to keep watching it again and again and again.

The 'Shawshank Redemption' undoubtedly deserves to be the highest rated
movie. The movie depicts how a four lettered word 'Hope' brings wonders
to our lives and makes something impossible to possible.<br/><br/>Though the plot of the movie focuses on how Andy Dufrane, a falsely
convicted prisoner gets out of the prison, the beauty of the movie lies
in the characterization of Andy Dufrane (just amazing) and how he
influences his fellow prisoner 'Red'. The narration by Morgan Freeman
in the role of 'Red' is perhaps one of the best narrations i have ever
come across. This story proves that the king of horrors, Stephen King,
is equally good at any other genre of 'Story Writing'(Hats off). The
dialogues towards the end of the movie about hope are truly inspiring.
The background score of the movie is excellent. Tom Robbins and Morgan
Freeman at their best in the roles of Andy Dufrane and Red
respectively.<br/><br/>Didn't watch the movie??...go grab a DVD and watch it as soon as
possible. Can't miss a movie like this....

I watched this movie for the umpteenth time probably last Sunday and
how much I loved it yet again!!! A movie I would never ever get bored
of and definitely, one of my all time favorites. A simple yet wonderful
story about HOPE!!! HOPE  One word that drives all of us and gives us
reason to live. We push ourselves through our mundane lives in the hope
of achieving / finding something that we dream of. In the words of this
movie's protagonist  ""hope is a good thing, maybe the best of things,
and no good thing ever dies""!!! Superlative performances by Tim Robbins
and Morgan Freeman.<br/><br/>A must watch if you haven't!!!

This movie I'm not going to call this film the IMDb #1 movie, but I
really can't deny that this is fantastic. The cast, the score, the
writing, and the power are all here in this film, and filled with
strength. It's one of those movies that you will continue to think
about even after the film is over. It is about a friendship, a life, an
evil, and a hope. A hope that is considered in many ways to be bridge
to insanity inside the prison walls. We see these people as years of
time goes by. We see friendships grow, and topics change. It really
puts you in the prison, and makes you feel what's like to behind those
bars. You feel the friendship, the hope, the darkness, and the pure
horror of it all.<br/><br/>4 stars out of 4

I never saw this film on the silver screen. I didn't want to see it on
video either.<br/><br/>The video store owner implored me to watch it and I remember my
emphatic reply. ""I'm not watching a 3 hour film about a prison con
doing tax returns for the guards"". Fortunately for me, this video store
owner was a mightily persistent sort and I begrudgingly walked home not
knowing that I had just rented the greatest film ever made.<br/><br/>This film received no hype nor the mega-bucks publicity given to a lot
of movie trash out there. Because they didn't need to - all they needed
to do was to let people watch it because word of mouth is the best
marketing ticket in town. And so it proved.<br/><br/>The movie is long and relies on a storyline which has been covered many
times. Wrongful conviction, brutality in jail, justice in the end. But
it is the way in which the story is told and acted out that defines it,
quite rightly, as IMDb's top ranked film.<br/><br/>I don't care for Stephen King as an author but his vivid imagination
coupled with his skill at telling a story (a short story in this case)
is top drawer. We have a man (Dufresne) who after being convicted
wrongfully for murder, uses his accounting skills in jail solely to
survive. Red (Freeman), the man who can ""get things"" befriends him. The
story then slowly unravels with shocking scenes of brutality
intertwined with flickers of how the human spirit can overcome the most
hazardous odds. The Warden, Samuel Norton, is magnificent as a man
whose corruption has spiralled out of control and will do almost
anything to retain the status quo. Clancy Brown as the brutal guard
completes the double act.<br/><br/>The story twists and turns leaving the audience not quite knowing
whether we are in for a harrowing or euphoric ending. And when the
ending comes on that Mexican Beach you can almost hear the triumphant
cheers ringing around the cinema halls.<br/><br/>This is film making at its very best and it is highly unlikely that
Robbins and Freeman will ever better it. Its one of those few occasions
where 10 stars is not nearly high enough.<br/><br/>So if you have been living under a rock or are as sceptical as I was in
the early 90's, then it's time for me to adopt my friendly video store
owners guise and say ""Watch this - its the best film ever made"".

Out of the three genre-defining classics released in 1994, The
Shawshank Redemption was the one that ended up bearing the maximum
brunt. First commercially by failing to recover its budget for it
debuted in theatres together with one of cinema's greatest watershed
events; Pulp Fiction. And then at Academy Awards where it was nominated
for seven Oscars yet failed to win any, thanks to the sweeping show by
the critics' darling, Forrest Gump.<br/><br/>But life ever since has been very kind to this film, and both critics &amp;
viewers have embraced its uplifting story of hope &amp; friendship with
remarkable amount of respect, love &amp; kindness. Today, The Shawshank
Redemption enjoys a position that's arguably even higher than the two
classics which eclipsed it back in 1994 and while it was discarded at
its time of release, it is now rightly &amp; universally acknowledged as
one of the greatest films of all time.<br/><br/>The Shawshank Redemption tells the story of Andy Dufresne, a successful
banker, who is wrongfully convicted of murdering his wife &amp; her illicit
lover and is ultimately sentenced to two consecutive life terms in
prison where his coping with the brutal hardships of confined life
slowly earns him the respect of his fellow inmates &amp; prison staff,
including that of ""Red"" in whom Andy finds a trusted ally. The
remainder of the film explores their friendship over the next two
decades.<br/><br/>Written &amp; directed by Frank Darabont, this prison drama is a simple but
profoundly moving tale of hope, friendship &amp; redemption that'll manage
to connect deeply with most of us in one way or another plus it also
marks Darabont's directional debut and he couldn't have asked for a
better start. All this film has is men in either prison or police
uniforms talking to one another over the course of its runtime and yet
it never looked dull or felt like dragging at any given moment.<br/><br/>Cinematography exquisitely captures the monotonous daily life inside
prison and provides considerable depth &amp; realism to the era this film
is set in. Every moment of despair has a shadowy appearance while
moments of hope gleam with light. Editing is spectacular too as the
gradual progression of Andy's life, his friendship with Red, and his
determination to not give in to the four walls containing him is
effectively unfolded. And Thomas Newman's score beautifully blends with
the film's tone &amp; characters' lives, and is emotionally fulfilling.<br/><br/>Coming to the performances, Tim Robbins delivers a swashbuckling
performance as Andy Dufresne, the banker wrongfully convicted for the
crime he didn't commit. And if Robbins is at his best, then Morgan
Freeman is even better as Red, Andy's friend who is also serving a life
sentence &amp; is notorious amongst the inmates for he can smuggle goods
into the prison. Freeman also narrates the story to us at which he does
an even better job. His work is grounded &amp; can go easily unnoticed, but
the character of Red is the soul of this story.<br/><br/>There is a reason why this film still connects with so many people &amp;
why many of them have latched on to it. There is a reason why even
after two decades, its legacy keeps flourishing &amp; viewers keep
returning to it despite its low entertainment value. One major reason
is that even though The Shawshank Redemption is a prison drama, its
story of imprisonment goes far beyond the bricks &amp; steel rods of a
jailhouse. The entire picture is a reflection of our own imprisonment
in the institutions of our daily lives; institutions like work, family,
society etc &amp; living up to the expectations of each one of them.<br/><br/>On an overall scale, The Shawshank Redemption stresses that based on
the outlook of life, there are only two types of people: one who can be
free even in prison while others who find themselves imprisoned even in
freedom. The message it is trying to resonate is clear: Fear can hold
you prisoner, Hope can set you free. And if we all give ourselves some
hope, there is nothing we can't survive. Yes, it all seems preachy n
everything, but then if there's ever been a motion picture that has
earned this sort of right, it's The Shawshank Redemption. Strongly
recommended.
